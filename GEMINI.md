# Project Context: CP3-AgileSquads - CRM para Hospital São Rafael

## Directory Overview

This directory contains the documentation for a university project: Checkpoint 3 for the "Agile Squads" discipline. The project's goal is to specify a Sales CRM (Customer Relationship Management) system for a fictional client, the "Hospital São Rafael".

The documentation is structured as an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) vault located in the `cp3-agile/` directory. This approach allows for the organized and iterative development of the required project artifacts.

## Key Files

The most important files in this directory are:

*   `CHALLENGE 2025.pdf`: The primary and complete specification for the entire challenge, detailing all the features and rules for the CRM project.
*   `CP3-Agile_intrucoes.md`: A markdown file summarizing the specific deliverables for the current checkpoint (CP3). It requires the creation of product vision, requirements, personas, and empathy maps.
*   `cp3-agile/`: An Obsidian vault containing the detailed documentation artifacts.
    *   `VisaoDoProduto.md`: Contains the Product Vision Statement, defining the target audience, needs, product, and key differentiators.
    *   `QuadroENaoE_FazNaoFaz.md`: Defines the precise scope of the project using the "Is/Is Not, Does/Does Not" framework.
    *   `Requisitos.md`: A comprehensive list of Functional, Non-Functional, Business, and Technical requirements for the CRM.
    *   `Personas.md`: Details the user profiles for the system's main actors: the Collaborator (sales/service team), the Doctor, and the Manager.
    *   `MapaDeEmpatia.md`: Provides Empathy Maps for each persona, offering deeper insight into their thoughts, feelings, pains, and gains.

## Usage

The contents of this directory are used to build the documentation for the university checkpoint. The workflow is as follows:

1.  The individual `.md` files within the `cp3-agile/` vault are created and populated based on the requirements from `CHALLENGE 2025.pdf` and `CP3-Agile_intrucoes.md`.
2.  These files serve as the source of truth for the project's specification.
3.  The final step is to consolidate the content from these Markdown files into a single `.pdf` document for submission, as mandated by the instructions.
